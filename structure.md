Title: 'Arrays'
Description: 'Like a vector, an array is a data structure used in C++ to store a sequential collection of elements. Unlike vectors, its size cannot be changed. Being able to store multiple pieces of related information in the same structure is very useful when writing C++ programs. When creating an array, you have to keep two pieces of information in mind: - The type of data you want to store inside it. - How many items you want it to be able to hold (its size). We can create an array a lot like we create normal variables, by specifying the data type, giving it a descriptive name, and also specifying its size: cpp'
